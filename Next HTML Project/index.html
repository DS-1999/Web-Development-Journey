                For those of us that are major ice cream lovers, but can’t quite eat the whole carton in one sitting, ice cream wins again. Rather than throwing away the remaining amount of dessert, you can simply throw it in the freezer.
                Ice cream can last weeks and even months in the freezer and can be enjoyed time and time again.

            <p>
                Ice cream is not only great by itself, but also with a wide variety of treats. Slap a scoop of vanilla bean on your favorite flavor of cake, try mint ice cream with a rich brownie, make that stuffed crepe even better with a scoop of chocolate ice cream—the possibilities are truly endless.
